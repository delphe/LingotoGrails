# LingotoGrails
This is a very old Grails project I was working on but never finished. It used to be in a private Bitbucket repo because I was concerned about my intellectual property being stolen. Now, I'm opening it up for scrutiny, possible support and the possibility of my ideas becoming a reality (even if I don't profit from it). I used this project to help me learn how to become a web developer. As a result, it is riddled with bugs and horrible code. I will gladly accept pull requests to fix any of the issues you see. However, if you log an issue, I might not get to it right away (or ever).
